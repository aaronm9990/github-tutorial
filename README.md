## Git vs. GitHub
**Git:** Git keeps track our projects and it keeps snapshot of code
but it doesnt reqiure github. 

**GitHub:** Github depends on Git to store it's commits of code on the cloud you are also able to work together with more than one person. GitHub can create a Repository when you are making a flie on c9.

## Initial Setup ** I think you should add steps to how to get your SHH key
**_Step 1_**: Create a Github account 

**_Step 2_**: Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)

**_Step 3_**: Once you signed up you'll need to connect your account to Git. 
**Build off or explain what you are trying to say in step 3**

**_Step 4_**: Cloud 9 and Github are now connected

## Repository Set **explain what a repo is**
For your respitory set up you have to use Git init and it would turn a directory into a repo  
`repo`

`git init`  
**For Repo setup you can go into detail and explain how and where you would git init**

---
## Workflow & Commands **for workflow and commands prehaps make a step by step process with syntax on how to do the commands**
`git add` is when you add a file to stage into your repo(respitory).

`git commit` is when you take a snapshot of the file you added to your stage

`git status` is important because you'll be able to check to see if your files have been added or not added into your workspace. It can also let you know if your commits has been pushed.
